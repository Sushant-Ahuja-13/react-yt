What is ReactJS -> It is a JS library used to make UI (complex frontEnd) formed by META in 2013 and most demanding
skill now.
To update somepart the whole website needed to be reloaded 
React => component based architecture
SPA -> single page application
library -> used to give a feature to a website eg-> GSAP(moving animation) Lenis(Smooth Scrolling) ReactJS(UI)
framework -> nextJS angular (all inbuilt is there and there is low customization in a framework)

library -> own a plot and then build your house
framework -> directly buy a flat or like and can do minimum changes

RealDOM(Actual DOM here everything gets reloaded or rerender) VS VirtualDOM(Copy of RealDOM technically 1 or sometimes 2 to 3)
VirtualDOM compares changes with the RealDOM and then reloaded the changed part only 
this reduces work load of system and make the app faster

JSX -> JavaScript XML (HTML + JavaScript)
